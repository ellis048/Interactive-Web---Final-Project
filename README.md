author: Ellis Yang

  Hello, This is the final project for Interactive Web design

Programs used:

-Webflow 

-Blender -I made the models and most of the animations


JavaScript:

-Threejs

-typedjs 


My process with this project: 
-

- When I had started with this project, i made a small template of just animations, then I had an idea of using blender and making a model; I really liked how apple and samsung displayed their specific products. I had made a format on Webflow, exporting their header but redesigning the index page. I did mention that I would use Typedjs library, implementing it subtly on the index and about section. Threejs was one of the hardest things i've worked on, learning how to make a scene, then adding a custom model, and formating it to work. I really like how this project looks, even though it is a static site, it is more dynamic than what github restricts to allow.
